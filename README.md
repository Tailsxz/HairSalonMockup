### Knowledge gained from this project
Learned how to draw inspiration from other designs. Also learned what the structure of an HTML document should look like for a standard business website. 
Learned the semantics behind using fieldsets and legends, and how to ensure that forms are up to WAI-ARIA standards.
Figured out a way to use the ::before pseudo element when using background images to make text more legible.
Learned A LOT about layout modes(algorithms) specifically regarding the table layout algorithms. Using a table-layout value of fixed will use the fixed algorithm, allowing the author to define the widths of the table, and its rows and columns.
First time hosting fonts locally, also first time converting ttf to woff2.
Got intersectionObserver API to work! First time using it as well, lets go!
Got more experience implementing babel and webpack/configuring webpack to work with babel.
Used embla to create a testimonial carousel, along with media queries for a responsive carousel.
First usage of data-attributes to define a state for the navigation bar and hamburger menu.
First time creating my own SVG for a hamburger icon, played around with strokes and dasharrays/offsets.
