Any planned future optimizations

### Knowledge gained from this project
Learned how to draw inspiration from other designs. Also learned what the structure of an HTML document should look like for a standard business website. 
Learned the semantics behind using fieldsets and legends, and how to ensure that forms are up to WAI-ARIA standards.
Figured out a way to use the ::before pseudo element when using background images to make text more legible.
Learned A LOT about layout modes(algorithms) specifically regarding the table layout algorithms. Using a table-layout value of fixed will use the fixed algorithm, allowing the author to define the widths of the table, and its rows and columns.
First time hosting fonts locally, also first time converting ttf to woff2.
Got intersectionObserver API to work! First time using it as well, lets go!
